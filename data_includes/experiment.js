    // experiment itself is over. If you are manually inserting a '__SendResults__' controller into
    // the shuffle sequence, you must set the 'manualSendResults' configuration variable to 'true', since

    // point in your running order. If given no options, the counter is incremented by one. If given
    // an 'inc' option, the counter is incremented by the specified amount. If given a 'set' option,
